This repository contains a simple example of the Decorator design pattern implemented in Java. The example code is related to my presentation on design patterns

======================================================================================================================

The Decorator pattern is a structural design pattern used to add new functionalities to an existing object at run time without modifying the structure of the existing objects.

Rather than creating subclasses for every possible combination of features, the Decorator pattern allows objects to be composed with additional functionality as needed.

Also known as wrapper and it enhances an object's functionality by wrapping it with one or more decorator objects
